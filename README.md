# High-Low-game
A simple code using if-statements and for loops
This code was created alongside Tim Buchalke's python course available on Udemy
It is intended to practice and get familarised with if-statements and for loops 
The intention of the code is to get a user to guess a number and the programme guesses it. 
This is done through binary search and a simple algorithm implemented through the if-statements/loop.
